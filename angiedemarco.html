		I am a college sophomore at Penn State University majoring in 
		Information Sciences and Technology with a focus on Design and Development.
		I also plan to double minor in Security & Risk Analysis and Sociology. 
		I have loved programming since my introduction to it during my freshman year of high school. 
		Below are some of the projects I've made over the years.

		In an effort to combat both police brutality and confusion over state rights, I designed and created a prototype for an app 
		that quickly and easily displays a user's rights given the state they are currently in. I separated the rights into three 
		easy-to-access sections: at home, when pulled over, and when walking outside. I also included a search bar that helps users 
		find rights, even those not included in the categories. This program was written using MIT App Inventor 2 and was completed
		independently as an assignment for my International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level course in high school.

		This website is intended for high school students. It takes in users' current grades, which are broken into formative, homework, 
		and summative categories. The website returns the lowest possible grade needed on a given upcoming assignment to 
		receive an A, B, C, and D. If a grade can not be obtained (for example if even a 0 would not result in a D), that grade
		will not be shown. This website was made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I made this website independently and did not make 
		it for any specific reason other than that I thought it would be helpful.

		As a junior in high school, three other students and I designed an app to encourage young girls to enter STEM fields and help lessen the gender gap.
		We competed our design in the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) Innovation Competition and won the 'People's Choice' award.
		You can read more about our design and the competition by reading the article shown on the left.
